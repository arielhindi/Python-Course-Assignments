this code helps convert common baking ingredients volume to weight and vise versa. 
this is very helpful for bakers who want to create their batter only using a scale and not cups, yet the recipe is all in cups.
this code asks for 3 inputs, the name of the ingredient, the amount, and the unit type, and prints out the amount in the other unit type. additionally, if asking for conversion of an ingredient which doesnt exist in the current library, the code will ask for the conversion ratio. 

all three code files were made with GPT-5 mini with the built-in AI VS chat.

my prompts were: 
1. i am currently taking a python course trying to teach us to utilize and implement ai in our assignments. please write a python code which will help determine common baking ingredient conversions from grams to cups or reverse. the code should first ask for 3 inputs: the ingredient, the amount needed which we want to convert, and the unit - g or cups/tbs/tsp. then it should print out the amount in the opposite unit. please ask me if there are more clarifications needed to write this code.
2. i would like you to add a command line mode, but please do so in another file in the day02 folder and name it "baking_conversions_command_line.py"
3. please create one last file, again in the day02 folder, utilizing the same code -but this time with GUI. please name it "baking_conversions_gui.py"
